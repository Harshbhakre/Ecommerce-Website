Project: E-commerce Website
Description
I have created an e-commerce website with the help of youtube using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end web development and my ability to build functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages.

Features:
1.Home Page: A welcoming page that introduces visitors to the website and highlights featured products.
2.Cart Page: A page where users can view items they have added to their shopping cart.
3.Account Page: A user account page that allows users to view and manage their personal information and order history.
4.All Products Page: A comprehensive page listing all available products, with filtering and sorting options.

Technologies Used:
